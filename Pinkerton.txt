Pinkerton by Shel Silverstein

Pinkerton loves me,
Pinkerton cares,
Pinkerton picks me peaches and pears.
Pinkerton offers me candy and Cokes,
Pinkerton listens and laughs at me jokes.
Pinkerton helps when I get in a fight,
Pinkerton does all my homework at night.
Pinkerton misses me,
Pinkerton cries,
Pinkerton thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Pinkerton is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Pinkerton just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Pinkerton's hand,
In the darkness where Pinkerton usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Pinkerton's gone!
